# AI-Content-Recommendation

This project is an AI-powered semantic search engine for educational content, designed to help learners discover relevant lessons, courses, and programs (nanodegrees) using natural language queries.

🎯 Core Functionality
The system recommends learning content at three granularity levels:
- Lessons — Specific skills/techniques (e.g., "sql joins", "python dictionaries")
- Courses — Broader topics with multiple lessons (e.g., "intro to python")
- Nanodegrees — Full learning paths/specializations (e.g., "data scientist", "generative AI")
